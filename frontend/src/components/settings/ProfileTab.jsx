## 🚀 Quick Implementation

Would you like me to:

**Option A:** Create a **complete single-file Settings page** that works immediately (no separate components needed)?

**Option B:** Create the **three separate tab components** (ProfileTab, SystemTab, UsersTab) for better organization?

**Option C:** Just add the **Settings route and navigation link** to make it accessible?

Which approach would you prefer? Option A is fastest and will work immediately!
